<h2>Worldwide Tax Calculator</h2>
<p>This package contains the Electron wrapper and a placeholder index.html. To use the full calculator:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace this file with the full single-file calculator HTML I provided earlier (ask me to paste it if you need it).</li>
<li>Open a terminal in this folder and run <code>npm install</code> then <code>npm start</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want, ask me now and I'll paste the complete full HTML into this project so it's ready to run.</p>
